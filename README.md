#  How to Build a PC

## Introduction
### Building a PC gives you much more control over the final specs and cost of a computer than if you were to purchase one already made from a retailer. This tutorial will serve as a guide on the basics of building a computer, beginning with what parts are needed and ending with updating the computer. For this tutorial, I will be focused on building a Windows based machine.

## Gathering Parts
### Where to buy parts
### Case
Cases (sometimes called a chassis, towers, system units, or cabinets) come in a variety of sizes and shapes and is a good place to start as it can affect what hardware you will be able to fit inside. There are several things to consider when purchasing a case. 1. How much space do you have for the tower? 2. What type of hardware do you want to put into the case? 3. How do you want the PC to look?

Typically, a case will be classified by the size of motherboard it can fit. ATX being the largest motherboard size, followed by MicroATX, and Mini-ITX as the smallest. 

Cases are also referred to in a different way as well. Cases labeled as small-form-factor typically arew quite small and designed to fit Mini-ITX motherboards. A desktop case is often smaller and designed to lay horizontally on a desktop, often so a monitor can sit atop it. Conventional vertical desktop towers are classified in 3 sizes: mini-towers, mid-towers, and full towers. These sizes do not represent exact measurements, so two mid-sized towers may vary in size.

For building a relatively powerful machine, having a larger case would likely be the best option as powerful hardware tends to be bulkier and larger in size. For the sake of this tutorial, I will assume that you will be using a case that can fit an ATX sized motherboard.
### CPU
Probably the most important piece of hardware to choose is the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Depending on your choice of CPU will affect which motherboard you need to purchase, which affects the other hardware will be compatible.

Presently, there are two major companies producing CPUs: Intel and AMD. In the past, Intel has dominated the higher-end CPU market, but recently AMD has begun to close the gap a bit. Because of this, you have more options now that previously. 

In terms of processing power, there are two specifications to look at when selecting a CPU: clock speeds and the number of cores. Having higher clock speeds leads to faster speeds and higher core counts leads to better multitasking capabilities. For things like gaming, having faster clock speeds is typically more important that having higher core counts. For other things like video editing or digital modelling, having more cores tends to have a bigger boost to performance than only clock speeds.

Use these two specifications to find a CPU that meets your needs and is within your budget. 
### Motherboard
The motherboard is a very important piece of the computer that enables all of the hardware to communicate with eachother. 

Depending on the CPU you choose to go with will depend on the motherboard you need to purchase. Intel CPUs and AMD CPUs will not work on the same motherboard as they use different connection ports. Typically, Intel alters the slot their CPUs with each new series of CPU to be released. For example, the most recent line of Intel CPUs (9XXX series) use a different socket than the 7XXX series released in 2017. This means that the two would need different motherboards as they would not fit into the same socket. 

AMD has taken a different approach in recent years and has decided to use the same socket type for new CPUs for the next few years. This means that if you want to upgrade your CPU in the future, you would not need to purchase a new motherboard like you would for an Intel CPU. 

After finding a motherboard that your selected CPU will fit into, the next step is to compare the features the motherboards have. Some of the important features to consider are things like onboard Wi-Fi  or the amount of USB ports a motherboard has. It is also improtant to choose one that is the appropriate size for your goals. As mentioned previously, powerful hardware tends to be large and bulky so if you plan on using the PC for intensive activities like video editing or gaming, choosing a larger motherboard size would allow you to fit bulkier parts easier.
### Video Cards
Next, is the Video Card, sometimes referred to as the GPU as it houses the Graphics Processing Unit. "Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing, and their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where the processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel." 

Certain motherboards, or even certain CPUs, may have onboard or integrated GPUs, meaning you would potentially not need to purchase one at all. For intensive graphical activities, having a dedicated or discrete GPU is an immense performance boost over an integrated GPU. 

Like with CPUs, there are two major GPU manufacturers: Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia GPUs are much more popular and have a much larger share of the market. 

There are a number of specs to consider when selecting a GPU. Among these are clock speeds, memory speed, and bandwidth. As virtually all of the specs are important, it is difficult to decide which will perform the best on paper. Because of this, I reccomend looking at benchmarks of various GPUs and deciding which one will meet your needs and compare their prices. The prices of video cards vary wildly with the newest flagship models being around $1200 and older models being less than $100. Benchmarks for various cards will give you a better idea of how the card will perform in a real world situation.
### RAM
Random Access Memory (RAM) is another critical piece of computer hardware. Moden computers nearly all use ram called Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (DDR SDRAM). There are a several variations of DDR SDRAM on the market currently. The most recent iteration of DDR SDRAM is called DDR4 SDRAM. DDR3 SDRAM is stil relatively popular, however. The newer iterations of DDR SDRAM have faster speeds and are more energy efficient. Depending on the CPU you chose for your build will determine what type of RAM will be compatible with your system (likely either DDR3 or DDR4). 

After determining which type of RAM you should purchase, next is how much you need. For simple tasks like basic office document work or web browsing, 4GB of RAM would likely be sufficient. 8GB is fairly standard for most situations. For more intensive activities like gaming or photo/video editing, 16GB would likely be a better choice. The highest-end machines will often have 32GB of RAM or even more, but these are edge cases and is not necissary for most people.
### Storage
Storage is an important aspect of the PC as it is what will store both the operating system and all of your programs and documents. There are two major types of storage on the market: Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD). HDDs has a disk that physically spins when it reads and writes to it. An SSD has no moving parts within it and instead uses integrated circuit assemblies to persistantly store data. Because of this, SSDs tend to be much faster than HDDs, but they are also significantly more expensive for the same amount of storage space. 

After choosing a type of storage device, it is important to select an appropriate size for the device. Depending on what you will be using the device for will determine what size disk you should purchase.
### PSU
The final part to choose for the internal of the PC build is the Power Supply Unit (PSU). This is the part that will deliver electrical power to all of the other internal parts. Because of this, it is important to get a power supply that will be able to sufficiently power all of the parts you have chosen. The GPU and the CPU are the most power intensive parts of a PC. Looking at the required power for these two should be able to give you a decent idea of what wattage power supply you should purchase. Having a power supply that can provide more power than you need will not hurt the other parts, however, so overestimating your power needs is often a good idea.
