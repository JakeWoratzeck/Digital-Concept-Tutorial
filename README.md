## Introduction
Building a PC gives you much more control over the final specs and cost of a computer than if you were to purchase one already made from a retailer. This tutorial will serve as a guide on the basics of building a computer, beginning with what parts are needed and ending with updating the computer. For this tutorial, I will be focused on building a Windows based machine.
This tutorial is aimed at people who are familiar with PCs but have never built their own or who might not be familiar with computing hardware. Because of this, the tutorial will only be providing high-level explanations of the hardware as getting more technical can be confusing for first-time PC builders. I will also be assuming that the PC will be running at stock conditions as overclocking can make a build much more complicated.

## Gathering Parts
### Getting Started
To get started, I would reccomend going to [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/). This website will help you browse all of the available hardware and makes it easy to compare different parts. It also can help you keep track of all your hardware and ensure that you are not forgetting anything essential. It also helps keep track of the total cost of the build and links to where you can actually purchase a part, most often Newegg, a popular technology retailer. The site will also inform you if any of the parts on your list will be incompatible with eachother.
### Case
Cases (sometimes called a chassis, towers, system units, or cabinets) come in a variety of sizes and shapes and is a good place to start as it can affect what hardware you will be able to fit inside. There are several things to consider when purchasing a case: 
1. How much space do you have for the tower? 
2. What type of hardware do you want to put into the case? 
3. How do you want the PC to look?

Typically, a case will be classified by the size of motherboard it can fit. ATX being the largest motherboard size, followed by MicroATX, and Mini-ITX as the smallest. 

Cases are also referred to in a different way as well. Cases labeled as small-form-factor typically arew quite small and designed to fit Mini-ITX motherboards. A desktop case is often smaller and designed to lay horizontally on a desktop, often so a monitor can sit atop it. Conventional vertical desktop towers are classified in 3 sizes: mini-towers, mid-towers, and full towers. These sizes do not represent exact measurements, so two mid-sized towers may vary in size.

Airflow is also important to consider when looking at cases as having the hardware inside it overheat can cause damage to the system. To remedy this, fans are typically attached to the case to circulate air in and out of it. Oftentime, a case will include several fans with it, but if it does not, you will want to pick up a few to protect your system from heating issues.

For building a relatively powerful machine, having a larger case would likely be the best option as powerful hardware tends to be bulkier and larger in size. I would reccomend selecting a case that can fit an ATX motherboard as you will have more space to work with, which is nice when building for the first time.
### CPU
Probably the most important piece of hardware to choose is the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Depending on your choice of CPU will affect which motherboard you need to purchase, which affects the other hardware will be compatible.

Presently, there are two major companies producing CPUs: Intel and AMD. In the past, Intel has dominated the higher-end CPU market, but recently AMD has begun to release products offering strong competition to Intel. Because of this, you have more options now that previously. 

In terms of processing power, there are two specifications to look at when selecting a CPU: clock speeds and the number of cores. Having higher clock speeds leads to faster speeds and higher core counts leads to better multitasking capabilities. For things like gaming, having faster clock speeds is typically more important that having higher core counts. For other things like video editing or digital modelling, having more cores tends to have a bigger boost to performance than only clock speeds.

Intel CPUs are classified by several levels: i3, i5, i7, and the newest, i9. The biggest variation between these tends to be core counts followed by clock speeds with i3s having lower core acounts and i9 having the most. Typically, the more cores, the lower the performance of each individual core will be. i7 and i9 CPUs typically also have a feature called hyperthreading, which divides a core into two virtual cores that can work simultaneously, improving multi-core workload speeds. On the newest generation of Intel CPUs, only the i9 uses hyperthreading and the i7 does not.

For AMD, their mainstream CPUs, called the Ryzen series, act in a similar way with Ryzen 3 being comprable to an i3, Ryzen 5 to i5, and Ryzen 7 to i7. It should also be noted that the term "hyperthreading" is exclusive to Intel. AMD has something called Simultaneous Multi-Threading, which is essentially the same.

For general purpose computing, an i5 or Ryzen 5 should be sufficient, but for more intensive computing, an i7 or Ryzen 7 will be the best bet. i3 and Ryzen 3 should only be considered for very basic computing tasks.

It should also be noted that a CPU will require a cooler to properly function. The latest AMD CPUs include a stock cooler with them, but the newer Intel CPUs do not, so you would need to purchase one. For the sake of this tutorial almost any cooler should be fine as I will assume the CPU will be running at stock speeds so overheating should not be an issue. Older generations of Intel CPUs did include a stock cooler, so depending on the CPU you select, you may or may not need to purchase one.
### Motherboard
The motherboard is a very important piece of the computer that enables all of the hardware to communicate with eachother. 

Depending on the CPU you choose to go with will depend on the motherboard you need to purchase. Intel CPUs and AMD CPUs will not work on the same motherboard as they use different connection ports. Typically, Intel alters the slot their CPUs with each new series of CPU to be released. For example, the most recent line of Intel CPUs (9XXX series) use a different socket than the 7XXX series released in 2017. This means that the two would need different motherboards as they would not fit into the same socket. 

AMD has taken a different approach in recent years and has decided to use the same socket type for new CPUs for the next few years. This means that if you want to upgrade your CPU in the in the near future, you would not need to purchase a new motherboard like you would for an Intel CPU. Current generations of AMD's mainstream CPU line, called Ryzen, use the AM4 socket.

After finding a motherboard that your selected CPU will fit into, the next step is to compare the features the motherboards have. Some of the important features to consider are things like onboard Wi-Fi  or the amount of USB ports a motherboard has. It is also improtant to choose one that is the appropriate size for your goals. As mentioned previously, powerful hardware tends to be large and bulky so if you plan on using the PC for intensive activities like video editing or gaming, choosing a larger motherboard size would allow you to fit bulkier parts easier.
### Video Cards
Next, is the Video Card, sometimes referred to as the GPU as it houses the Graphics Processing Unit. "Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing, and their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where the processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel." 

Certain motherboards, or even certain CPUs, may have onboard or integrated GPUs, meaning you would potentially not need to purchase one at all. For intensive graphical activities, having a dedicated or discrete GPU is an immense performance boost over an integrated GPU. 

Like with CPUs, there are two major GPU manufacturers: Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia GPUs are much more popular and have a much larger share of the market. 

There are a number of specs to consider when selecting a GPU. Among these are clock speeds, memory speed, and bandwidth. As virtually all of the specs are important, it is difficult to decide which will perform the best on paper. Because of this, I reccomend looking at benchmarks of various GPUs and deciding which one will meet your needs and compare their prices. The prices of video cards vary wildly with the newest flagship models being around $1200 and older models being less than $100. Benchmarks for various cards will give you a better idea of how the card will perform in a real world situation.
### RAM
Random Access Memory (RAM) is another critical piece of computer hardware. Moden computers nearly all use ram called Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (DDR SDRAM). There are a several variations of DDR SDRAM on the market currently. The most recent iteration of DDR SDRAM is called DDR4 SDRAM. DDR3 SDRAM is stil relatively popular, however. The newer iterations of DDR SDRAM have faster speeds and are more energy efficient. Depending on the CPU you chose for your build will determine what type of RAM will be compatible with your system (likely either DDR3 or DDR4). 

After determining which type of RAM you should purchase, next is how much you need. For simple tasks like basic office document work or web browsing, 4GB of RAM would likely be sufficient. 8GB is fairly standard for most situations. For more intensive activities like gaming or photo/video editing, 16GB would likely be a better choice. The highest-end machines will often have 32GB of RAM or even more, but these are edge cases and is not necissary for most people.
### Storage
Storage is an important aspect of the PC as it is what will store both the operating system and all of your programs and documents. There are two major types of storage on the market: Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD). HDDs has a disk that physically spins when it reads and writes to it. An SSD has no moving parts within it and instead uses integrated circuit assemblies to persistantly store data. Because of this, SSDs tend to be much faster than HDDs, but they are also significantly more expensive for the same amount of storage space. 

After choosing a type of storage device, it is important to select an appropriate size for the device. Depending on what you will be using the device for will determine what size disk you should purchase.
### PSU
The final part to choose for the internal of the PC build is the Power Supply Unit (PSU). This is the part that will deliver electrical power to all of the other internal parts. Because of this, it is important to get a power supply that will be able to sufficiently power all of the parts you have chosen. The GPU and the CPU are the most power intensive parts of a PC. Looking at the required power for these two should be able to give you a decent idea of what wattage power supply you should purchase. Having a power supply that can provide more power than you need will not hurt the other parts, however, so overestimating your power needs is often a good idea. 
### Monitor
Something important not to forget is to purchase a monitor as well. There are a wide variety of monitors to choose from with widely varying specs and equally varying price points. 

While there are a ton of varying types of monitors, to keep it simple, there are 3 major specifications to consider when looking for a monitor:
1. Resolution
2. Refresh Rate
3. Response Time

Resolution will refer to how many pixels there are on the display. The higher the resolution, the more crisp an image will appear. Nowadays, common monitor resolutions include 1080p (1920x1080), 1440p (2560x1440), and 4K (3840x2160 OR 4096x2160). 

The refresh rate refers to how many frames the monitor can display each second. A higher framerate will result in smoother movement. Common refresh rates are 30Hz, 60Hz, 75Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz, 280Hz.

Response time is the amount of time a pixel takes to change measured in milliseconds. A lower response time leads to less blur around moving objects and less visual artifacts. Common response times are 5ms, 3ms, and 1ms.

When selecting a monitor is important to determine what the system will be used for. For basic tasks like watching videos or web browsing, virtually any monitor will be sufficient. For gaming, where there is large amounts of movement, a higher refresh rate and lower resposne time will be desireable. A higher resolution is often always more desireable, but the higher the resolution, the more processing power it takes to render all of the pixels. Because of this it is important to gauge which is more important to you: higher framerates or higher resolution. For gaming, the framerates will largely be dependent on your graphics card, so looking at benchmarks for the card at various resolutions will help you determine what level of performance you can expect and help you decide which monitor you should purchase. 

### Periphreals
Purchasing perophreals will vary wildly from person to person. The most important things to purchase are a mouse and keyboard. Any will do, but oftentimes people will have personal preferences about these. Speakers are another periphreal to consider, but what you purchase will largely be up to your personal needs and preferences.
### Operating System
As you will be assembling the PC from the ground up, you will also need to install an operating system to the computer for it to be able to function. For the sake of simplicity, I will assume you are going to be installing Windows. To do so, you will need to purchase a USB flashdrive to hold the operating system for installation. It is possible to use DVD instead, but a USB is much more convenient. 

Note: A CD will not work as it will not have enough storage capactiy to store the operating system.

Below is a link to Microsoft's support page detailing how to create a Windows Installation USB.

## Assembling the Parts
As the parts you have chosen will vary, it is near impossible to provide exact instructions for assembling all of your parts. Some things to note:
1. Ensure you stay grounded and avoid any static while working with the parts. Discharging the static onto the parts (especially the motherboard) could damage the hardware and prevent it from working.
2. Do not have any power flowing to the system while you are plugging in or unplugging any parts as this could also damage the parts
3. Once the PC is assembled, do not touch the parts while it is powered on as this could cause a short and ruin the build.
4. Try to keep the cables as organized in the case as possible. Depending on the case, there are likely holes to feed cords in and out of to keep them organized. Dealing with all of the cords is often one of the most challenging parts of building a PC so the more organized you can be, the easier it will be.

Below I have linked two resources for assembling the PC hardware as they do an excellent job walking through the process and they have been useful to me in the past when building a PC. There is a both a text guide (with pictures) and a video guide depending on your preference.

## Installing the Operating System
Once all of the parts have been assembled, it is time to finally boot up the new PC, but before you can do that, you have to install Windows. To do so, plug the Windows Installation USB into one of the USB ports on your motherboard. On first boot, the PC will likely go directly into the BIOS. The layout of the BIOS will vary drastically between motherboards but you should search for an option to boot to a USB flash drive, or simply find an exit button. As there is no installation of Windows on your HDD or SSD, the system should boot to the flashdrive where you installed Windows. If everything goes correctly, you should be met by a Windows installation screen where you can follow the onscreen directions to install Windows.

## Finishing Touches

Once you have successfully, installed Windows, you are essentially done! It is a good idea to check for Windows updates to ensure that you are running the most recent version of the operating system. Also important is to update all of the drivers for the components on your PC. You can either search the web for drivers for each individual part, or use a driver installation tool to make the process easier. I have linked one such program below. It has a free trial for its premium version, which should be more than sufficient for installing all the drivers to get your system up to date.
